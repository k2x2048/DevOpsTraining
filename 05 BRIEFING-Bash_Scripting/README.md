# Bash Scripting

## The Mission

As you might be aware by now, when you type instructions (_commands_) at your prompt, you're actually speaking in a **shell language** that is **interpreted by the shell** (_most commmonly Bash on Linux system_). However most shells can actually go further and interpet instructions directly from a file, also called a **script**. Writing scripts can simplify your life tenfold and allow you to **automate processes** by simply dumping a set of commands into a file (_a script_) and executing them when needed.

In other words, so far you have used the **shell** directly from the command line, but after this challenge you will be able to use it by scripting as well! Go through each one of the exercises below to learn more about **Bash scripting**:

* [Syntax](./exercises/syntax.md)
* [Are you my friend?](./exercises/friend.md)
* [Web Scraping](./exercises/scrap.md)

Each exercise will ask you to write a different script, store them in a folder called `script`, and push it to your fork of the repository, so that they can be reviewed later.

> **NOTE**: Shell scripting language are especially good at processing data (input, output) and system administration, but it should be complemented with other languages (C, Python, Ruby, etc...) for other kinds of tasks.

## Expected Output

At the end of this challenge you should be **able to use to write simple Bash scripts**, which should be verifiable by a folder called `script` containing all the scripts you had to write during this challenge.
