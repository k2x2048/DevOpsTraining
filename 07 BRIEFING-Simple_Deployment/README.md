# Simple Deployment

## The Mission

This challenge will have you **deploy an application** on a Linux machine, namely [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) a git repository server inspired by Gihtub. Hopefully, and as this might be your first deployement, you will be guided by the official installation documentation.

- [Setup a database](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/database-prep/) to manage the application's persistant data (_MySQL_ or _PostgreSQL_).
- [Setup the application](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/install-from-binary/) itself so that you have access to the service.
- **Harden** the Linux machine so that it is secure.

As a bonus you could also write a script to monitor the machine and keep you updated on the status of the Gitea service through mail.

## Expected Output

At the end of this challenge you should be **able to deploy services on a Linux machine**, which should be verifiable by a running instance of Gitea.
