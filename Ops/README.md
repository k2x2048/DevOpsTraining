# The Many Ways of Ops

## Description

The Sysadmin training aims to bridge the gap between eager to learn individiuals and a promising job market in need of "_Ops_" engineers. It does so by providing a timeline of [competency based](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competency-based_learning) exercises, guides and projects. The field of IT is however fragmenting quickly into many specializations (_DevOps_, _CloudOps_, _DevSecOps_, _..._), which will be reflected in the course through a common trunk of knowledge followed by specializations.

## The Timeline

The timeline itself is subdivized into **four phases**, each one tackling the "_learning process_" slightly differently. They are as follows:

- [The Field](./timeline/field/summary.md) (_6 weeks_): an introduction to the methodology and fundamentals of system administration.
- [The Hill](./timeline/hill/summary.md) (_12 weeks_): a deep dive into the required concepts and technologies to be a proficient Sysadmin in a given field (_DevOps_ or _CloudOps_).
- [The Mountain](./timeline/mountain/summary.md) (_4 weeks_): an all encompasing project to consolidate the acquired competencies.
- [The Summer Pasture](./timeline/summer_pasture/summary.md) (_4 weeks_): an independent learning time to fill in the blanks and prepare for the internship.

> For those who find themselves with some time there is also the [extras](./timeline/extras.md), a collection of challenges not included in the main timeline but related or useful to IT.

## Training's Documentation

We don't expect you to remember every bit of information concerning the BeCode way of doing things by heart, which is why you can always refer to the documents below if you have questions about the training, its processes, the rules to follow and more.
