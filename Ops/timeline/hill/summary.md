# The Hill

## Description
	
The "_Hill_" solely focuses on preparing the trainees to face modern deployment infrastructure as well as some associated tools. This section is heavy in new concepts and paramount to acquiring the necessary competencies to enter the job market competitively.

## Section's Content

As the current world of IT is fragmenting into different roles, the content itself will also be divided into the following specializations:

- [DevOps](./devops.md)
- [CloudOps](./cloudops.md)

Each Trainee will have the opportunity to choose which one to focus on during the Hill. If times allow, either now or in the summer pasture, the other path can also be explored.
