# Environment Setup

## The Mission

In order to learn effectively during the course you'll need a configured computer, that's why your very first challenge will aptly be to **setup a basic working environment** on your machine. Easier said than done, right? Afterall what does a "_correctly configured machine_" even looks like?

Well, given some requirements it will be your job to find out! Indeed, **there is more than one way to achieve efficiency** and my working environment might not work at all for you. Which is why we decided to provide you with a list of base "**must be able to**", your working environment as to respect, from there you have full agency. Here are the specifications:

- Have access to the [Linux](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/) operating system.
- Have a [text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) installed.
- Have access to a [terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator).
- Have access to [virtual machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine).
- Have [Discord](https://discord.com/) available with the BeCode server added ([invite](https://discord.gg/yU9DRDVj)).

It's important that you take the necessary time to research the available options **so that your setup feels right** to you. That being said we'd be remiss not to mention we'll be using both **Linux** and its **command line** extensively throughout the training. Take that into consideration when making a decision on your most effective setup for the job.

## Expected Output
