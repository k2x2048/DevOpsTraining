# Package Management

For this exercise you need to **install** and then **uninstall** [exa](https://the.exa.website/) (_an `ls` replacement_) using three different methods: [building from source](https://the.exa.website/install/source), by [downloading the binary](https://the.exa.website/install/linux#manual) and finally using your Linux distro's [package manager](https://the.exa.website/install/linux#manual). In all cases the package must be usable from anywhere on the system.

> **IMPORTANT**: The most common way to install packages on a system is by using a package manager, however as a system administrator you will often have to download pre-built binaries or build software from source in order to install them.
