# Service Management

This exercise will have you learn how to manage [services](https://www.imaginelinux.com/service-in-linux/) through [SystemD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) with the `systemctl` command.

- List all the started services on your system.
- Write a simple script appending a file with a message every 10 seconds.
- Create a SystemD service to run this script in the background.
- Start your service
- Check its status
- Stop the service

> **INFO**: There are other ways to deal with services but none is as dominant as SystemD in the enterprise world.
