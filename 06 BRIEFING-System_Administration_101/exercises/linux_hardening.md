# Linux Hardening

It's nice to be able to setup machines and install services on them, but it's better if they are also secure. This exercise will have you **harden** a linux machine against basic potential threat.

- List all the open ports on the machine.
- Use `ufw` to close unneeded ports.
- Ensure that the `root` user cannot connect via SSH
- Remove password login via SSH (_use ssh keys instead_)
