# Golang Syntax

## The Mission

The [Golang](https://go.dev/) programming language has quickly made its mark on the IT world as particularly well suited, amongst other things, for system development and scripting. This challenge will have you **learn its syntax** and **practice it** by doing some algorithmical **exercises**.

Follow the instructions below to get started:

- Follow the [Go Tour](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1) (_or any tutorial_) and complete as many modules as you can.
- After you feel comfortable with the language and its syntax, complete these [exercises](./exercises.md) in order to pratice and ensure that you truly understand what you learned.

> **NOTE**: If you are done with all the provided exercises and feel comfortable with the syntax, but still find yourself with some time. Feel free to head to a site like [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) to practice some more.
