Code story
==========

Slash is *locked* in a room.  
We should go out but he doesn't know the **code** to open the door.  
He sits and thinks.  

He remembered the number of his living house    
He tried the code "2124"  
It doesn't worked  
  
At first, he tried punching his way out.  
Usually his fist never failed him but not this time.  
He only succeeded to hurt himself  
He has no regrets about his action
