# Permissions

[Permissions](https://www.guru99.com/file-permissions.html) are a very important concept for security on any Linux system, here are four commands that will help you manage the permissions of files and folders `sudo`, `chmod`, `chown` and `chgrp` (_they require administrative rights_). Open your **terminal** and **read their manuals** to understand them, then follow the instructions below:

- create a file
- check the owner and group of the file (use `ls`)
- change its owner to *root*
- change its group to *root*
- check that file's permission (use `ls`)
- give all rights to owner and group, but none to others
- try to print the file on screen
- print the file with root privileges
