In Linux there are three main commands to explore the file-system `cd`, `ls` and `pwd`. Open your **terminal** and **read their manuals** to understand them, then follow the instructions below:

- print your location on the screen
- print the content of your current directory
- print the content of `/`
- move to the folder `/bin`
- print your new location
- go back to your home folder

Ever wished you could teleport? Well, check out `pushd` and `popd` (_BASH only_) to get amazing warping power.

- move to any location on your file system for a quick job
- pop back to your previous location to get back to work
