# File Operation

There are plenty of commands to interact with files and folders on your system, here are the most common: `cat`, `touch`,
`mkdir`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm` and `rmdir`. Open your **terminal** and **read their manuals** to understand them, then follow the instructions below:

- create a file named `one.txt`
- type `echo "Hello World" > one.txt`
- print the content of that file on the screen
- create a folder named `story`
- move `one.txt` into that folder
- copy `one.txt` inside the folder `story` as `two.txt`
- print the content of both files
- rename `one.txt` to `part_one.txt` and `two.txt` to `part_two.txt`
- type `echo "I am a junior at BeCode." > part_two.txt`
- print the content of both files simultaneously
- remove the folder `story` and all its content

Quick question to keep you busy, there are two ways to remove a folder, do you know both?
