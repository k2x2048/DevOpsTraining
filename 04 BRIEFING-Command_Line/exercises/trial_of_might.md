# Exercises Linux CLI - Trial of might

If you arrived here you should already have forged yourself a base understanding of the _command line_, now it's time to **test your might**. For that, you will have to go through one of the challenge put together by the guys at [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org) Basically, they provide servers with computer science puzzles to solve. The one you will have to tackle is named **Bandit** and is aimed at the testing your knowledge of the fundamentals (_but not so simple_) of the CLI.

- do some **research** on how to connect to a remote server via [SSH](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/)
- follow this [link](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) to the bandit game and follow the instructions there
- **complete a maximum amount of levels** and **take note of the passwords** for each one of them
