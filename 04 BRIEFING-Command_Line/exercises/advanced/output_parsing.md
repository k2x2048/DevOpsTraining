- research and learn [REGEX](https://ryanstutorials.net/regular-expressions-tutorial/)
- read the manual of `grep` and `sed`
- use `grep` to parse for task happening at BeCode
- use `sed` to replace all instance of _practice with_ by _learning_

Optionally and if you have time you should also look into the amazing `awk` command.

NOTE: These commands are very *powerful*, but can also be *complex*. Which is
why you should try to search for more exercises to practice. This briefing only
serve as an ice-breaker with these three commands.
