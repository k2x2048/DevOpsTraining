# The Linux CLI

## The Mission

Although obscure to the none initiated, one of the most efficient way to manage your computer is through the use of the [command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) (_CLI_), a **prompt** enabling you to interact with the machine via **commands specifying actions** to be performed. Both _Windows_ and _Linux_ have access to a CLI, albeit different ones, but this challenge will focus on the Linux CLI.

This challenge aims to break the ice with this new textual interface as well as provide you with the basic tools found in a Linux environment. To achieve this you will have to **solve multiple exercises** ranging from an interactive web based game introducing the base concepts to a "_Trial of Might_" testing the knowledge acquired thus far. Go through each of the exercises below and make sure you understand before moving on to the next.

1. [Introduction](./exercises/introduction.md)
2. [Fundamentals](./exercises/fundamentals/README.md)
3. [Advanced](./exercises/advanced/README.md)
4. [CLI Sherlock](./exercises/cli_sherlock.md)
5. [Trial of Might](./exercises/trial_of_might.md)

> **NOTE**: A "_prompt_" is just a piece of software that interprets the commands you type to the machine, as such there exists many variant called "_shells_". The most common one is [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) which is based on its predecessor [SH](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell), but you can find plenty of alternative online such as the popular [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org/), or even the modern [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) (_my personal favourite_) and many more. In this training we'll usually assume that you're using BASH but feel free to use whatever best fit your needs, you'll most likely need to know how to use more than one anyway.

## Expected Output

At the end of this challenge you should be **able to use the Linux CLI for common tasks**, which should be verifiable by aÂ text file called `passwords.txt` containing all the passwords for the "_Trial of Might_", one password per line.
