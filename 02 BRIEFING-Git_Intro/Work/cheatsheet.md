# Everything I've learned on Git and Github

Git is a software who analyse, record and manage modifications in a directory.
It record changes and backup modified files (with checksum and snapshots) in a .git hidden folder.
You can then check, validate and revert all modifications.

Git can be linked to a remote repository like Github, GitLab or Bitbucket
This way all poeples of a team can work on the same project at the same time.

Each developper must install git on his computer.
Then he can download (fetch/pull) remote repository to a local folder.
He can add files, modify project, describe changes (add, commit).
He can then send change (push) to remote repository.
Changes will be checked and merged with remote repository.
