# Versioning with Git

## The Mission

The [versioning tool](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) **Git** is arguably one of the most important software to master in the modern tech world. It redefined how file versioning should be done and as a result found its place as a critical tool in workflows for both development and operational teams across the industry. We can't emphasize enough how important a tool it is to know. This challenge will have you break the ice and explore its fundamentals.

First things first you need to get acquainted with what Git is exactly:

- Get a feel for the techonlogy by reading this [article](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F) from the documentation.
- Complete this interactive [web based training](https://www.w3schools.com/git/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_getstarted1) (_requires account_).
- [Install](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) and [configure](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) Git on your local machine.

You can find alternative tutorials in the "[Complementary Resources](#-complementary-resources)" section below, if you don't like the one provided or want/need some more practice.

Now that you have the basics of the tool it's time to dive into it's most common companion, **Github**. Git itself is already an amazing tool but to really make use of it you generally need a remote server to push your changes to, that's where Github comes in. Follow this [guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to create your first repository on Github and explore its base features.

Pretty cool, huh!? You should already be able to **initialize projects** with Git, **host them on a remote server** with Github and use the most basic, yet important, git workflow: `git pull`, `git add`, `git commit` and `git push`. It's now time to put all that newly acquired knowledge to the test!

- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the challenge on your Github account.
- Clone it on your local machine to work efficiently.
- Write a _cheatsheet_ of everything you've learned on both Git and Github.
- Add, commit and push the cheatsheet to your fork of the exercise.

Optionally, and if you find yourself with some time, you can also try to explore alternative remote repository hosting services such as [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product).

## Expected Output

At the end of this challenge you should be **able to use both Git and Github base workflow**, which should be verifiable by a fork of this repository with a **text based cheatsheet** of everything you learned on `Git` and `Github` so far.
